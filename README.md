# Resume

I am an immediate joiner & looking for a software development Role. I have a strong understanding of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Problem-Solving, with a keen interest in competitive programming. I actively participate in online coding competitions on CodeChef and have achieved notable ranks there. 

My experience spans Software Development, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Full-Stack Development. In AI, I developed a Differentially Private GAN model to generate synthetic data while preserving user privacy. In ML, I built Fakify (Fake Image Detection) and Stockify (Virtual Stock Prediction Platform), applying deep learning techniques for real-world applications.

Additionally, I have hands-on experience building scalable web applications, implementing secure authentication, and working with backend technologies. With proficiency in Java, C++, Python, MySQL, NoSQL, RESTful API design, and modern web frameworks like React.js and Node.js, I am passionate about solving complex problems, optimizing system performance, and building innovative tech solutions.
